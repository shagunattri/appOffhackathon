Efficient way for Saving and Accuured Expense for a strong Finance - finQ -Team Knownsense

In the world of smart cities the finance is the most important factor and saving is the backbonne of financial strength, keeping that in mind we present a Web-App finQ.

Our objective is to Incorporating gamification and product simulation into financial products provinding financial confidence and financial guidance.

In order to * implement our idea* we provide our users a better view to his/her finance, looking to the user's income we ease out the problem of extra cost and give them a chance for savings for a better future from his/her own income without any problem to his present that takes to the Sustainable Saving. We also introduced the loyalty points to our users and they can achive them only when they completed there goal what they have set for the monthly saving which they can use as discount during ordering food online, online shopping, booking flights, hotel rooms, cabs or movie tickets from the platforms of our parterners.

The basic idea behind the project is to introduce the users of smart cities that to be financially strong they need to save there income and it could be possible with there basic needs and entertainment together with an Accured Expense.

For the application of our idea we have a Web-App finQ which gives our users a platform from where they can sign-up and later login. The users are required give there upi account details to link there bank with finQ to keep track to their income and expances from which we can provide them a overview to their extra cost and savings. They also need to give the record of the expance they made (category), and they need to set a minimum amount based on there income for the monthly saving. After they achieved their goal they will be provided with the loyalty points for what they need.

We ensure to our users that their data with us will be secured and safe, there will be no chances of hacking or any data loss.
